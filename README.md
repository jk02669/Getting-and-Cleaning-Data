# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
* The main program of the project is run_analysis.R.
  * Data Source is UCI HAR Dataset.zip
  * The R program assumes the data is already downloaded to the working directory.
  * If you open the R console and type in source("run_analysis.R"), it will run the whole data clean up work
  * It will take about 20 seconds on my laptop, might take less or more time on other computer but should not exceed a couple of minutes.
  * After the program is done, it will produce a "tidy_data.txt" which is the cleaned tidy data set the assignment asked.
  * The format of "tidy_data.txt" and transformation process of "run_analysis.R" are documented in CodeBook.md.
  * The detailed program document are added in the run_analysis.R itself.
